#### Overview
This course introduces students of the MA in Digital Humanities program to project design and computer programming. It focuses on core programming skills, built upon PHP foundations introduced in DIGH 401, development patterns and methods, and practical skills for the development and management of a digital humanities framework and project.

Students gain practical experience with coding, design, and version management with the final goal of publishing a working framework for project publication and development. Students are given the opportunity to present and demonstrate their frameworks and project as part of the final course assessment.

#### Some core course goals include:

* introduce DH students to project design and computer programming
